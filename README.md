# KANBN

A cli Kanban application

## Plans

Add, edit and track tasks using the command line, e.g:
`kanbn init`
`kanbn add -t "My task"`
`kanbn mv my-task column-name`
etc..

All commands should have an interactive mode

There will also be a cli user interface for viewing the kanbn board and making changes in the terminal

There will also be a vscode extension allowing you to view the kanbn board and make changes in a webview/activityview

There will also be https://kanbn.io, allowing you to 'publish' your kanbn board, and will use github webhooks to keep the board up-to-date. This will enable extra abilities, like team collaboration (with swimlanes?), tracking multiple projects in a single board, easily view task history, etc...
