{b}kanbn sort "column"{b}

Sort a column in the index. The "column" value is optional if sorting a column interactively.

Some task attributes can be optionally transformed using case-insensitive regular expressions.
If a filter is specified, the matched text will be used when sorting.

If the filter regular expression has numbered capturing groups, the value of the first group will be used.
If the filter regular expression has named capturing groups, the value of all named groups will be concatenated.
If there are multiple matches, their values will be concatenated.

Options:
  {b}kanbn sort --interactive{b}
  {b}kanbn sort -i{b}
    Sort a column interactively.

  {b}kanbn sort --save{b}
    Save the column sort settings in the index file. This means that any tasks added to the column will be automatically sorted.

  {b}kanbn sort --ascending{b}
  {b}kanbn sort -a{b}
    Sort the column in ascending order. This is the default order. This option can be set after each sorting field. If this option is set before any sorting fields, all fields will be sorted in ascending order.

  {b}kanbn sort --descending{b}
  {b}kanbn sort -z{b}
    Sort the column in descending order instead of default ascending order. This option can be set after each sorting field. If this option is set before any sorting fields, all fields will be sorted in descending order.

    Sort tasks by id.

  {b}kanbn sort --name "filter"{b}
  {b}kanbn sort -n "filter"{b}
    Sort tasks by name.

  {b}kanbn sort --description "filter"{b}
  {b}kanbn sort -d "filter"{b}

  {b}kanbn sort --sub-task "filter"{b}
  {b}kanbn sort -s "filter"{b}
    Sort tasks by sub-tasks.

  {b}kanbn sort "Todo" -z -n --count-tags{b}
    Sort tasks in the "Todo" column first by name, then by the number of tags, all in descending order
